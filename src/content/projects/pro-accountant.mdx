## Overview
**FactPrice** is a modern invoicing system I'm designing to optimize sales and tax document management for companies. Its main objective is to simplify the issuance of electronic invoices in compliance with DGII standards, while also offering an intuitive interface, automatic XML generation, and digital signature. FactPrice seeks to integrate efficiency, security, and control into a single environment, adapting to the needs of businesses of different sizes.

## ‚ùì Problem
The accountant faced these challenges:
1. Manual invoicing process: Many companies still generate their invoices manually, which leads to human error, wasted time, and makes it difficult to maintain accounting control.
2. Compliance with the DGII (General Directorate of Information Technology): Generating and sending electronic invoices to the DGII (General Directorate of Information Technology) requires compliance with specific technical standards, which complicates implementation for businesses without technological knowledge.
3. Lack of integration and automation: Traditional systems typically fail to connect with inventories, customers, or real-time reports, which limits decision-making.
4. Data security: Invoice and customer information is not always managed with adequate encryption or access control mechanisms.
5. Unintuitive interface: Some invoicing software is complex and unfriendly, generating resistance from users.
